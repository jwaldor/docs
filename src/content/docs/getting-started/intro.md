<a href="https://www.membrane.io" target="_blank">membrane.io</a> is a serverless JavaScript and TypeScript runtime for building automations and integrations. Membrane programs are deployed and managed directly through the [Membrane Web IDE](/getting-started/install#membrane-web-ide).

Membrane significantly lowers friction to run cron jobs and workflows, create Discord and Slack bots, poll websites, handle webhooks, and more.

<!-- TODO: Add a visualization that communicates what membrane is in a few seconds -->
