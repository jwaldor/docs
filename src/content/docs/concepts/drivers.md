title: Drivers
---

A _driver_ is a Membrane program whose sole responsibility is to expose the functionality of third-party APIs in your Membrane account so that other programs can easily make use of it. You can see all the drivers maintained by Membrane in our <a href="https://github.com/membrane-io/directory" target="_blank">directory</a>.

There's nothing fundamentally special about a driver. It's a program just like any other. That means you can create your own drivers for you or other Membrane users to use.

:::note
If you do create a driver, feel free to submit a PR to our directory! We'd love to include it. Or open a PR to improve an existing driver.

## Installing drivers

To install a driver in your Membrane graph, click the `New` button in the Navigator panel and select `Program Registry`. This will display all drivers and examples in the directory.
