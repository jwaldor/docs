{/* TODO: replace github link with /share link */}
This roadmap is generated dynamically from a <a href="https://github.com/membrane-io/operations/tree/main/public-roadmap" target="_blank">Membrane program we wrote</a> to fetch tasks from our `public-roadmap` list in <a href="https://height.app/product" target="_blank">Height</a>.

{/* TODO: replace github link with /share link */}
That program uses the <a href="https://github.com/membrane-io/membrane-driver-height" target="_blank">height driver</a>, which simplifies interacting with Height's API. Feel free to fork the program! Or if you'd like to set up something similar for a different tool (e.g. <a href="https://linear.app" target="_blank">Linear</a>), reach out to us <a href="https://discord.gg/sbRcqC7QxE" target="_blank">on Discord</a>â€”we'd be happy to help.
